Conclusion:  
To win over time and have a positive expected value on your investments  
(be it with time or money):  
- Run many iterations / experiments  
- Study your investment to minimize the loss in each bet  
- Each bet must be small (little leverage) and have a big potential upside  
  
Over time, your success is inevitable.
